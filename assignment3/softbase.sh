# i search the source code inside web.txt and see that the images i need, all
# shares the same url and are exclusive to the rest of the source code of thw url

#The grep command is used to search text or searches the given file for lines containing a match to the given strings or words
#cat command allows us to create single or multiple files, view contain of file, concatenate files and redirect output in terminal or files
# cat the web part and redirect the output to a new file newweb.txt
